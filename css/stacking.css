/* --- CV Layout Overlap Fix --- */

/* 1. Establish Positioning Context */
.cv-container {
    position: relative; 
    /* The row itself becomes the reference point for absolute positioning */
}

/* 2. Position the Sidebar */
.sidebar-panel {
    /* Ensure the sidebar has a defined height or its content will define it */
    min-height: 100vh;
}

/* 3. Position the Overlapping Element */
.name-block {
    /* Take the element out of the normal flow */
    position: absolute;
    
    /* Move it leftward by an amount that causes the overlap. 
       Adjust this 'left' value (e.g., 100px) based on your needs. */
    left: -150px; 
    
    /* Align it vertically. You may need to tweak the 'top' value. */
    top: 50px; 
    
    /* Ensure it sits on top of the sidebar */
    z-index: 10;
    
    /* Add styling to match the image (e.g., width, padding, background) */
    width: 400px; /* Make it wide enough to cover the overlap area */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); /* Use the body black background */
    color: var(--bs-body-color);         /* Use the white text color */
}

/* Optional: Styling for the placeholder circle to prevent overlap issues */
.pic-holder {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 15; /* Ensure the image is on top of the name block */
}
